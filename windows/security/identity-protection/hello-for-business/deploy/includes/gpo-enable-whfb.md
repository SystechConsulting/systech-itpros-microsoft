You can configure the [Use Windows Hello for Business](../../policy-settings.md#use-windows-hello-for-business) policy setting in the computer or user node of a GPO:

- Deploying the computer node policy setting, results in all users that sign-in to the targeted devices to attempt a Windows Hello for Business enrollment
- Deploying the user node policy setting, results in only the targeted users to attempt a Windows Hello for Business enrollment

If both user and computer policy settings are deployed, the user policy setting has precedence.
