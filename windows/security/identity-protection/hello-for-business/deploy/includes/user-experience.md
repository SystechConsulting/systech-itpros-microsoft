After a user signs in, the Windows Hello for Business enrollment process begins:

1. If the device supports biometric authentication, the user is prompted to set up a biometric gesture. This gesture can be used to unlock the device and authenticate to resources that require Windows Hello for Business. The user can skip this step if they don't want to set up a biometric gesture
1. The user is prompted to use Windows Hello with the organization account. The user selects **OK**
1. The provisioning flow proceeds to the multi-factor authentication portion of the enrollment. Provisioning informs the user that it's actively attempting to contact the user through their configured form of MFA. The provisioning process doesn't proceed until authentication succeeds, fails or times out. A failed or timeout MFA results in an error and asks the user to retry
1. After a successful MFA, the provisioning flow asks the user to create and validate a PIN. This PIN must observe any PIN complexity policies configured on the device
1. The remainder of the provisioning includes Windows Hello for Business requesting an asymmetric key pair for the user, preferably from the TPM (or required if explicitly set through policy). Once the key pair is acquired, Windows communicates with the IdP to register the public key. When key registration completes, Windows Hello for Business provisioning informs the user they can use their PIN to sign-in. The user may close the provisioning application and access their desktop
