##  Windows Hotpatch

Windows Hotpatch is a feature designed for immediate security compliance and minimized disruptions. With Windows Hotpatch, organizations can apply critical security updates without requiring a system restart, reducing the time to adopt a security update by 60% from the moment the update is offered. Hotpatch updates streamline the installation process, enhance compliance efficiency, and provide a per-policy level view of update statuses for all devices. Importantly, delays in organizational security compliance due to update deferrals or postponements are eliminated with Hotpatch updates, ensuring timely and consistent deployment across the tenant.

By utilizing hotpatching through Windows Autopatch, the number of system restarts for Windows updates can be reduced from 12 times a year to just 4. This means less downtime, a streamlined experience for users, and a reduction in security risks. By addressing security vulnerabilities immediately—without compromising user productivity or system availability—Hotpatch ensures that enterprise environments remain secure, compliant, and operationally efficient. This technology, proven in the Azure Server environment, is now also available for Windows 11 client devices enrolled in Windows Autopatch.
