### Allow enhanced PINs for startup

This setting permits the use of enhanced PINs when an unlock method that includes a PIN is used.

Enhanced startup PINs permit the use of characters (including uppercase and lowercase letters, symbols, numbers, and spaces).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Not all computers support enhanced PIN characters in the preboot environment. It's strongly recommended that users perform a system check during the BitLocker setup to verify that enhanced PIN characters can be used.
